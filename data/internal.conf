#(when a thread is "synced", it sleeps until a new frame has been/should be simulated)

#only render when new simulation has been done:
sync_graphics	true #disable for max fps

#normally the physics thread sleeps to sync with "realtime" to minimize cpu usage.
#if your OS got bad scheduling/relatime/latency then sleeping might cause problems.
#this option allows disabling of sleeping in favor of spinning (busy-waiting)
#note: puts 100% load on physics thread - might cause new problems if single cpu/core!
