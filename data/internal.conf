#tweaks to improve multithreading experience:
#(when a thread is "synced", it sleeps until new data has been/should processed)

#try to run simulation in "realtime":
sync_simulation	true #disable for warpspeed

#only render when new simulation has been done:
#(not vsyncing, more like "simulation syncing")
sync_interface	true #disable for max fps

#normally the simulation thread sleeps to sync with "realtime" to minimize cpu usage.
#if your OS got bad scheduling/realtime/latency then sleeping might cause problems.
#this option allows disabling of sleeping in favor of spinning (busy-waiting)
#note: puts 100% load on simulation thread - might cause new problems if single cpu/core!
