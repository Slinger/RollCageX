#this file is meant to solve some problems with the current lack of menus.
#the current race mode is just a debug mode thing:
# one single user (with one profile) controls all cars ("players")
#
#the idea here is to mimic menu selections for now:
#hello, welcome to rc! select a profile (or create a new):
profile default

#main menu... player selects "race"... and free-roam mode
#select world:
world Sandbox
#select track:
track Box

#waiting for players...
#one player
#please select team:
team Nemesis
#what car?
car Venom
#ok, tyre and rim
diameter 2 #rim diameter
tyre Slick #by world or track)
rim Split #by team or car)
#todo: automatic spawning position instead of
#manual x and y coords relative to track start
position -8 0

#another player joins the cage
team Nemesis
car Venom
diameter 2
tyre Slick
rim Split
position 8 0

#ok, end of file: cage is closed, race will start!
