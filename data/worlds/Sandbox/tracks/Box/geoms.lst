#since roads can easily become very big (with many triangles),
#they should be divided into smaller pieces for optimization:
# * reoccuring parts are reused
# * rendering of only the visible parts
# * collision detection on only triangles of potentially colliding parts

#todo: should probably implement inclusion of multiple geoms.lst
#files through this file, or some way of splitting ".road" files...
