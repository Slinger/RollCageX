#Collision surface defaults that can be modified:
#> mu 0 bounce 0 spring inf damping 0
#more (less interesting) defaults (for tyre rection):
#position 1 sharpness 1 rollingres 1

> mu 1 #1N/N friction
#(now all following geoms will have mu=1 if not changed)

#
#the following geoms can be used (sorted by performance):
#
# sphere radius [options]
# - good performance and accuracy
#
# capsule radius length [options]
# - good but might get stuck on collisions
# - total length is 2*radius+length
#
# box width depth height [options]
# - reliable collisions and acceptable performance
#
# trimesh filename resize [options]
# - needs a lot of processing, not always reliable
# - NEVER use a 3D model with MANY triangles
# - resize is scale, "1" means no resize
#
#
#[options] can be any of the following:
#
# p[osition] x y z
# - position relative to center of car
#
# r[otation] x y z
# - not point for spheres (not needed)
# - rotation (euler angles) in degrees
