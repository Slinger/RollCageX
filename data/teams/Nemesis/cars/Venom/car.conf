max_torque 800000
max_break 60000 #for soft breaks
motor_tweak 1.0 #1 for normal torque decrease (higher for higher, lower for lower)

#prevents the high motor torque from flipping the car over
torque_compensator true

#values from 0 (rear) to 100 (front) for how much the front/rear wheels are used
