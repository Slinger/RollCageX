max_torque 140
max_break 60 #for soft breaks
motor_tweak 0.0 #1 for normal torque decrease (higher for higher, lower for lower)

#prevents the high motor torque from flipping the car over

wheel_slip 0.03 #slip in sideway (based from rotation speed)
wheel_mass 0.4 #in kg
wheel_erp 0.9 #hardness
wheel_cfm 0.2 #softness (should be used, but zero for now)

body_mass 6 #in kg

#values from 0 (rear) to 100 (front) for how much the front/rear wheels are used
