#motor+gearbox:

#how much torque (by rotation speed, unit: Nm*rad/s)
power 2000000


#there are two motor+gear combination alternatives:
# * continuously variable: full usage of power, decreasing torque by velocity
# * electric motor: power usage increases by velocity, constant torque (until max velocity)

#only for normal, continuously variable, option:
#if rotation goes under this level, will not get more torque
gear_limit 30 #gearbox only operational above this rad/s

#only for electric motor option: (enabled by setting this to non-zero)
#constant torque until power usage exceeds motor_power
electric_torque 0 #0=normal (continuously variable) motor+gearbox


#limit torque on wheels if in air (motor+breaks)
#(used to prevent car from flipping over when leaving ground)

#distribution of motor between front and back
#(set both true for 4WD)
motor_distribution false true #only rear driving

#differential: even distribution of motor torque over wheels
#(disable this to get one (weaker) motor+gearbox for each wheel)
differential true

#redistributes torque over wheels based on how their velocity differ
#(like a "limited slip differential", but supports all wheels)
torque_redistribution false true #adjust rear wheels to each others

#allow different velocity based on turning
adaptive_redistribution true

#how quickly the differing velocity should be fixed

#breaks:

max_break 150000 #for soft breaks, drifting is always inf

#distribution of breaks between back and front
#(drifting breaks are not affected - always locks rear wheels)

max_steer 30 #degrees

#distribution of steering between back and front

#change maximum steering this fast
