#motor:
max_torque 400
max_break 600 #for soft breaks
motor_tweak 0.8 #1 for normal torque decrease (higher for higher, lower for lower)

#prevents the high motor torque from flipping the car over
torque_compensator true

wheel_mu 1.6 #normal friction
wheel_slip 0.04 #slip in sideway (based from rotation speed)
wheel_mass 0.4 #in kg
wheel_erp 0.8 #hardness
wheel_cfm 0.1 #softness

body_mu 0.1
body_slip 0.01 #when colliding with other cars' wheels (note: have not tried this)
body_mass 4 #in kg

#values from 0 (rear) to 100 (front) for how much the front/rear wheels are used
